# Fatura Project

## Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive invoicing system composed of a Next.js frontend application, a Python FastAPI backend, and a Supabase backend for database and authentication services. The entire environment is containerized using Docker for streamlined development and deployment.

## Architecture

The project is structured as a monorepo with the following key components:

-   **`apps/fatura-admin`**: A Next.js application that serves as the admin dashboard for managing invoices. It includes features for data visualization, printing, and generating QR codes and barcodes.
-   **`apps/api-python`**: A Python application built with the FastAPI framework. This service provides backend functionalities to support the frontend application.
-   **`supabase`**: Contains the configuration for Supabase, which is used for the database, authentication, and other backend services.
-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: The main Docker configuration file for orchestrating all the services.
-   **`kong.yml`**: A configuration file for Kong, an API gateway that manages requests between the services.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your system:

-   [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started)
-   [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or higher)
-   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

## Getting Started

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
    cd your-repository
    ```

2.  **Set up environment variables:**

    Create a `.env` file in the root directory by copying the example file:

    ```bash
    cp .env.example .env
    ```

    Update the `.env` file with your Supabase credentials and other required configurations.

## Running the Applications

To run all the services together, use the following Docker Compose command:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

This command will build the Docker images and start the containers for the frontend, backend, and Supabase services in detached mode.

### Frontend Application

-   **URL**: `http://localhost:3000`
-   The Next.js application is served by the `fatura-admin` service. The application will automatically reload on file changes.

### Backend API

-   **URL**: `http://localhost:8000/docs`
-   The FastAPI application is managed by the `api-python` service. You can access the API documentation at the `/docs` endpoint.

### Supabase Services

-   **API URL**: `http://localhost:54321`
-   **Studio URL**: `http://localhost:54323`
-   Supabase Studio provides a web interface for managing your database and services.

## Database

The project uses a PostgreSQL database managed by Supabase. Database migrations and seeds are located in the `supabase/migrations` and `supabase/seeds` directories, respectively.

To apply migrations, you can use the Supabase CLI or run the database initialization scripts.

## Deployment

For production deployment, it is recommended to use a managed database service and configure the environment variables accordingly. The Docker images can be built and deployed to any container hosting platform.
